# RoomReady
The ultimate App for guests to be in the know about their stay. 

## Description
This hotel app helps guests manage their stay and helps housekeeping staff track room status efficiently. Guests can log in to update their room's housekeeping status with a click and check progress while away. If cleaning is ongoing, they can use the "Plan My Day" page to view the weather and local events.
